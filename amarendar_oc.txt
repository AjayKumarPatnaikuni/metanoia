Every Oracle Cloud Infrastructure resource has an Oracle-assigned unique ID called an Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID). It's included as part of the resource's information in both the Console and API

If you use the API, you'll need the OCID for your tenancy. You can a resource's OCID by using a "List" API operation on that resource type,
or by viewing the resource in the Console
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ocid1.<RESOURCE TYPE>.<REALM>.[REGION][.FUTURE USE].<UNIQUE ID>

ocid1: The literal string indicating the version of the OCID.
* resource type: The type of resource (for example, instance, volume, vcn, subnet, user, group, and so on).
* realm: The realm the resource is in. A realm is a set of regions that share entities. The only possible value is oc1.
* region: The region the resource is in (for example, phx, iad, eu-frankfurt-1). With the introduction of the Frankfurt region, the format switched from a three-character code to a longer string. This part is present in the OCID only for regional resources or those specific to a single availability domain. If the region is not applicable to the resource, this part might be blank (see the example tenancy ID below).
* future use: Reserved for future use; currently blank
* unique ID: The unique portion of the ID. The format may vary depending on the type of resource or service.
